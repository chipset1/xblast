Completed:
gameLoop -- start end screen. main gameplay is done. failure state is added
Update spawn behavior
-- once the enmy has past the end of the screen then reinitialize them
add score
- + 10 everytime an enemy is killed
health pickups
limit number of player bullets
- add in enemy manager

pickup should affect bullets - DONE
- its possible for the player to sit in one position and shoot left and right without any risk of being hit which makes for a boring game
- one way to balance this is to make the enemy movement or spawn more sofisticated e.g spawns from the top side of the screen,
  have the velocity of the enemies be more dynamic,
- the option impleted will be that the picks will give health and bullets
- controlling the player is the most fun and interesting part of the game and more movement should be encouraged
- having pickups give the player bullets and health should make the player move more
Particleos
add in particles + background to sketch
add particles on death
initial enemy explosion particles

initial pickup particles
bullet particle
add zoom in particle to pickup

space out picks up more
-- have a picks not be able to spawn close to each other
-- currenting their spawn position is a random point on the screen
-- Fix1: divide screen into quaters and cycle spawning pickpus in them
-- Fix2: check the positions of all active pickups when spawning new pickups if its not outside the minmum
         distance try and spawn else where
-- what was implemented was Fix plus a check is made if the pickup spawn position is close to the player
   if it is then the next area in the array is choosen
bullets can be killed
background shimmering
have enemy explosion affect other enemies and player
-- when a collision happens bettween bullet to enemy or player to enemy
   Collides with player: a force pointing away from collided enemy apply to player and enemies with a certain distance
   Collides with bullet: apply to surrounding enemies within a certain distance
enemy off screen position resets
-- explosive force should be affected by the distance it is
- screen shake. with a explosion happens the screen shakes

Current:
-- enemy effects makes screen dark
-- enemy that
-- enemy that leaves a flame/lave path behind it that hurts the player

Defered:
tweek particles

   emenies with a centain flight path like in 1942
   enemies that spawn other enemies
   enemy that leaves a flame/lave path behind it that hurts the player

-- ellipse lays background that hurts enemies

player better acceleration integration
add health and bullet bar
particle pool
have explosions effect the player and other game objects
player rocket exhausts
-- have particles only created when the mouse is release doesing look that good.
