* Completed:
   gameLoop -- start end screen. main gameplay is done. failure state is added
   Update spawn behavior
   -- once the enmy has past the end of the screen then reinitialize them
   add score
   - + 10 everytime an enemy is killed
   health pickups
   limit number of player bullets
   - add in enemy manager

   pickup should affect bullets - DONE
   - its possible for the player to sit in one position and shoot left and right without any risk of being hit which makes for a boring game
   - one way to balance this is to make the enemy movement or spawn more sofisticated e.g spawns from the top side of the screen,
     have the velocity of the enemies be more dynamic,
   - the option impleted will be that the picks will give health and bullets
   - controlling the player is the most fun and interesting part of the game and more movement should be encouraged
   - having pickups give the player bullets and health should make the player move more
   Particleos
   add in particles + background to sketch
   add particles on death
   initial enemy explosion particles

   initial pickup particles
   bullet particle
   add zoom in particle to pickup

   space out picks up more
   -- have a picks not be able to spawn close to each other
   -- currenting their spawn position is a random point on the screen
   -- Fix1: divide screen into quaters and cycle spawning pickpus in them
   -- Fix2: check the positions of all active pickups when spawning new pickups if its not outside the minmum
   distance try and spawn else where
   -- what was implemented was Fix plus a check is made if the pickup spawn position is close to the player
   if it is then the next area in the array is choosen
   bullets can be killed
   background shimmering
   have enemy explosion affect other enemies and player
   -- when a collision happens bettween bullet to enemy or player to enemy
   Collides with player: a force pointing away from collided enemy apply to player and enemies with a certain distance
   Collides with bullet: apply to surrounding enemies within a certain distance
   enemy off screen position resets
   -- explosive force should be affected by the distance it is
   - screen shake. with a explosion happens the screen shakes
   -background audio
   -- score points should be higher
   --respawn particle feds
   -- tweek explosion distance scaling
   -- background alpha shimmers
   -bullet particles
   -health ui
   -- bullet ui
   - theres a stroke around the player when remaining bullet > 0
   - the distance between the stroke and the player grows as the remaining bullets increase
   --pickup location spawning
   - clean up, move unused code to spare.js
